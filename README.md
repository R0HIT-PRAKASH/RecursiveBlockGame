# RecursiveBlockGame
FULL DISCLOSURE: This is a first year university project. As such, the outline of the project (how the majority of public methods are organized and how classes are coupled) was determined by the professors, NOT BY ME. I contributed most public method completion and helper methods. I did not contribute to the structure of this project. I am also not responsible for the GUI created by this program; I generate the valid information and submit that to the already made GUI code. 

This code uses a recursive block object that stores other blocks to run a game which can have different goals depending on how it is set up. There are different options for what you can do on a block, as well as objectives, score counts and colour descriptions.
